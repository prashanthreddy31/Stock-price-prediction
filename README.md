# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Deep Learning (RNN, LSTM, GRU)

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using Deep Learning sequence models:

* Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
* Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
* Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

The objective is to compare the performance of these models in time-series forecasting of stock market prices.
